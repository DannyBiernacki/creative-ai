    CREATIVE AI STUDIO 2025 - CORE DEVELOPMENT RULES
    
    ## Language & Communication
    - ZAWSZE respond in Polish for all interactions
    - GOAL: Help achieve Creative AI Studio 2025 development goals efficiently
    - When unclear about MCP integration patterns - ask for clarification with examples
    
    ## MCP-First Development Workflow
    1. ALWAYS START with MCP server integration analysis
    2. THEN setup multi-agent coordination patterns
    3. FINALLY implement creative features with background processing support
    4. Use @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for ALL external integrations
    5. Ensure proper agent-to-agent communication via MCP protocol
    6. Add comment after changes: // enhanced with MCP/agents - [timestamp]
    
    ## Creative Workflow Standards
    - Brand compliance validation on ALL creative outputs
    - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance mandatory
    - Multi-framework code export (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte)
    - Background processing ready for autonomous tasks
    - Real-time collaboration with human + AI teams
    
    ## Performance Requirements
    - MCP tool calls: < 500ms response time
    - Agent coordination: < 100ms inter-agent communication
    - Background tasks: 99%+ completion rate
    - Creative canvas: 60fps minimum performance
